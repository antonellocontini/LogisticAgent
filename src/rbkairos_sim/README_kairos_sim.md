# rbkairos_sim

## Install

For the first time run the following command from workspace root:
```
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
```

## Usage

In the tmux, set the `USE_KAIROS_SIM` flag at true, then choose the number of robots with the `NROBOTS` parameter
(currently only 1 and 2 are supported)

In the tmux script, set the initial positions for the robots (these are read by gazebo),
then do the same in the initial_poses.txt file for the configuration of your choice (these are read by the agents).

Currently, only the `icelab_room` map is supported, this has been generated by the real kairos.

## Add new maps

This is a brief explanations of the steps to add new maps
Costmaps (.pgm and .yaml files) go in the summit_xl_localization/maps folder

3D models of the room (for gazebo) go in rbkairos_gazebo (tutorials on how to do so online)

Graph file (.graph) goes in logistic_sim/maps folder
